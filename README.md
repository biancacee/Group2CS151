PROBLEM TO SOLVE
We are hoping to address several issues relating to user access to accurate weather and temperature information that several weather apps currently face. We hope to solve the issue of the lack of accessibility by creating a weather app with a plethora of functionalities to display and predict accurate weather information as well as get rid of any inconsistencies in weather-predicting algorithms. 

PREVIOUS WORKS
Projects from classes include:
CMPE-131, CMPE-133, CMPE-157A

ASSUMPTIONS/OPERATING ENVIRONMENTS/USAGE
We will be using JavaFX and Scene Builder to create this weather app. Additionally, we will obtain an existing PAI from a weather provider, such as MetaWeather, and use JSON to retrieve weather application information. 

With Maven we will need to add necessary dependencies for creating HTTP requests, including libraries such as the Apache HttpComponents library

SOLUTION 
We hope to provide the best user experience in weather applications using an existing API to provide real-time weather forecasts.

PLAN 
Decide which framework and database to use
API integration with an existing weather API
Create app architecture and design
Use Agile development process
Provide testing and quality assurance

APPROACH
Using Java we will select a framework such as React
Integrate an existing API such as OpenWeatherApp
Use JSON to parse responses
Create an appealing UI to incorporate our project

FUNCTIONALITY
The functionality of this application relies on the implementation of an API to provide the end user with accurate weather information. This weather information includes, but is not limited to, current weather conditions and predictions of future weather conditions; this information will be presented in several ways including air temperature, humidity, wind, UV index, precipitation expectancy, and others. Our goal is to provide accurate weather information for short-term and long-term forecasts. We hope students will use this application as their source of weather forecasts.


OPERATIONS 
End-user:
Input and Change desired location for weather information
View and access weather information
Input and view the desired time frame for weather information
Access short-term, and long-term weather forecasts
View sunrise and sunset times
Customize Units and Preferences including degrees in Fahrenheit or Celcius
View radar/satellite information
Receive alerts and warnings
